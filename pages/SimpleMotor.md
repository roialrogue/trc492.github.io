# Simple Motor
Motor is the most fundamental component in a robot. It provides movement of mechanisms. There are many different types of motors with different capabilities. Some capabilities are built-in to the motor hardware. Some are provided by the *Smart Motor Controller* the motor is connected to. Smart Motor Controllers usually have their own microcontrollers running firmware at a higher frequency than the Robot Controller. They can provide native close-loop control at a much higher resolution than software close-loop control running on the Robot Controller. For example, some motors have built-in quadrature encoders. Encoders are sensors that keep track of the rotational position and velocity of the motor. Some encoders are even capable of registering absolute positions (i.e. absolute rotational position persists across power cycles - doesn't get clear across power cycles). Some capabilities are provided by Smart Motor Controllers the motors are connected to such as supporting limit switches. Limit switches provides protection against mechanisms travelling beyond their physical range limits. They will cut motor power if the mechanism hits the lower or upper physical limits. Some motor controllers provide hardware counters that count encoder pulses.
