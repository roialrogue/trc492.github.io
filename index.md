## Welcome to Titan Robotics Club

The Titan Robotics Club is a middle and high school robotics program at the International School in Bellevue, Washington. We aim to spread awareness and raise interest within our school and our community about robotics and the programs of FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). As part of the annual FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST Tech Challenge and FIRST Lego League, our team of around 100 students work with field professionals and adult mentors to earn valuable life experience with robotics, technology and science. You can learn more about us at our [official website](http://www.titanrobotics.com).
