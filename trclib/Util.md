### **Util**  
The **Framework Library** provides **trace logging** for debugging and performance analysis during robot matches. This tool is invaluable for **post-mortem analysis**.  

- **Log Levels**:  
  - **VERBOSE**: Detailed logging for debugging.  
  - **DEBUG**: Logs for in-depth analysis.  
  - **INFO**: General match information.  
  - **WARNING**: Logs for potential issues.  
  - **ERROR**: Logs errors.  
  - **FATAL**: Logs critical errors that halt the robot.  

By adjusting the logging level, you can tailor the output to your needsâ€”use **INFO** for competition logs or **DEBUG/VERBOSE** for troubleshooting.
