### **Drive Base Odometry**  
Our **drive base odometry** supports both **drive motor odometry** and **passive wheel odometry (Passive Odometry Pods)**. This allows us to calculate the robot's absolute field location using:  

- **Drive Motor Odometry**: Reads from either the drive motors or passive wheels.  
- **Gyro Heading**: Incorporates gyro heading for accurate localization.  

This combination ensures precise positioning of the robot within the field.
