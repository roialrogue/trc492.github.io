### Data Filters and Processors  

In the real world, **sensor data often contains noise**, which can negatively impact robot control. The Framework Library provides a suite of **data filters and converters** to clean up sensor readings and improve accuracy.

#### Data Filters  
The Library includes several popular filtering techniques to reduce noise in sensor readings:  
- **IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filters**  
- **Kalman filters**  
- **Spurious filters**  

These filters help smooth out fluctuations in sensor data, making it more reliable for real-time robot control.

#### Data Converters  
The Framework Library also provides **data converters** for specific sensor-related challenges, such as:  

- **Data Integration** – Some gyros only provide **rotational rate** rather than absolute heading. The Library offers a **data integrator** to calculate heading by integrating rotational rate over time.  
- **Non-Contiguous Value Handling** – Certain sensors, such as gyros and compasses, report values that suddenly "jump" at specific points. For example:  
  - The **REV IMU gyro** transitions from **179° to -180°**.  
  - A **compass** shifts from **359° back to 0°**.  

  These discontinuities can disrupt control algorithms. The Library provides a **value converter** that detects and corrects such transitions, ensuring a smooth, continuous data scale.

By leveraging these filters and processors, the Framework Library enhances sensor accuracy and stability, leading to more precise and reliable robot control.
