### **Path Following**  
Our framework supports **Pure Pursuit Drive path following**, enabling the robot to follow:  

- **Pre-Planned Paths**: Navigate to targets with predefined paths.  
- **Dynamically Generated Paths**: Create paths in real-time based on data from vision systems. This is especially useful when the robot is navigating to dynamically detected targets.  

Path following is essential for tasks like autonomous navigation and targeting in competitions.
